**Whats Unique**
This paper elaborates on current peer review process, expectations, limitiations, flaws and possible next steps to improve it.

**How Reviewers Cope**
* Writing Style
* Narrow topics
* Work not on English
* Already famous work or from a well known labs
* Too simple solution
* Non-mainstream approach
* Resource papers
* Novel approches
* Substitute questions
    * How good is this paper -> are there obvious ways to improve this paper, or If I did this study, would i make the same choices

**Can we just abolish peer review**
* Findings of EMNLP -> Not a good way to create a second tier category, as it would create bias all over.

**What can we do**
* Better reviewer matching**
* More fine-grained tracks**
* Reviewers forms tailored for different papers
* Announcing editorial priorities pre-submission
* Not asking overall recommendation score
